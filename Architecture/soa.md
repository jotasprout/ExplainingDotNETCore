# SOA: Service Oriented Architecture

it's a modularized way of designing your application- instead of your server solely existing for your UI app, we design the server to exist as a service that your UI can use, but also other machines can use. We build API's to share the data

## SOA Principles

These are some of the guiding principles to help design your web services
- Service Contract
    - Your service, should operate based on a standardized contract
- Service Composability
    - should be small, and be composed of other services that does one thing well
- Loosely Coupled
    - your services should not be codependent/tightly coupled/in other services business
- Abstraction
    - Your service should not show its gut - aka, provide a simple interface for users to use
