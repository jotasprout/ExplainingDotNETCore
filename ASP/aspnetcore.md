# ASP.NET Core (continued)

ASP.NET Core is a Web Application Framework available for .NET Core. It supports building various styles of web applications, such as web forms, web apps with server side rendering, pure API, and API with SPA app built in. Access the scaffolding and templates via Visual Studio or `dotnet new`

## Middleware

- There are many things (such as request parsing, routing, authorization/authentication, etc.) that needs to be done for Every request that comes to the application even before it reaches our application logic. To handle those repetitive tasks, ASP.NET Core offers a _middleware pipeline_. This is a pipeline of middleware in assembly line style, where the request is processed by a line up of middleware where one middleware will do stuff to the request then call the next, then that one will do their own stuff and call the next... so on and so forth until it reaches the controller. This pipeline is configured in program.cs and is executed before it reaches the controller.

## Controllers

ASP.NET Core controllers inherit from the class ControllerBase that offers many functionalities that can help developers handle http requests.

- Controller based routing: Controller wide routing is set on top of the controller definition as an attribute, the sub-routing is then defined on top of each action with the method
- Action: Public methods in controllers that handles http requests
- ActionResult<>: the type that ControllerBase's methods returns (ie. Ok(), Conflict(), Created(), etc.)
- _Be mindful of how you're naming these controllers, the framework expects the controllers to be named_ `<ControllerName>Controller.cs`

## Model Binding

Classes that inherit the ControllerBase class also offers model validating through DataAnnotations namespace. With DataAnnotaions, we can simply annotate on top of our model properties to require a certain set of validations via attributes, when the controller class, upon data binding, will automatically check for those validators and return 400 Bad Request Response if it fails any of the validations.

## Caching

ASP.NET Core offers ability for endpoints to cache their resources in memory, through MemoryCache. This can offer a performance boost but also can be expensive (because it stores data in memory).

## Filters

Filters work similarly to middleware that they address cross-cutting concerns as in, concerns that occur to many different scenarios. Filters are different from Middleware though, in that they work inside of the controller context.
There are 5 different types of filters that execute in a particular order, and filters are used as attributes on top of either a controller or an action.

## Integration Testing

Integration Testing is interested testing the whole application working together. We do not isolate any one component or fake any dependencies, instead we set up testing client and test DB's to use the entire application to test each layers working seamlessly together. (We'll use things like testing client and inmemoryDB's)
Pros: integration testing allows us to test the whole app (including the framework, db access codes, etc, that relies on external resources)
Cons: High setup overhead and cost in running integration tests.
