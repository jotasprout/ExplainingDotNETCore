# Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is in essence renting someone else's infrastructure/hardware
The demand for web presence in businesses kept increasing but not all businesses have the resources/funds/time to manage their website/application from ground up. Cloud service providers, such as AWS, Azure, and GCP provide the hardware, differing levels of infrastructure/services so businesses can focus on what they do the best.

## Benefits
- Ease of scaling 
    - you can scale your infrastructure up or down depending on fluctuating demand very quickly (also possibly automatically)
- Pay as you go pricing
    - Pay for only what you use
- You get best industry practice re: security, hardware maintenance, etc.

## Cloud Models
- Public
    - These resources are open to everyone
- Private
    - These resources are open to only your organization

- On-premise
    - The infrastructure you maintain
- Hybrid
    - A mix of your infrastructure and the cloud service provider's infrastructure

## Different types/levels of services
- IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service
    - Cloud Service provider provides hardwares and raw computing power
    - ex: Virtual Machines 
- PaaS: Platform as a Service
    - IaaS + any software needed to run the server
    - ex: Azure Sql Server, Azure App Services
- SaaS: Software as a Service
    - PaaS + the application
    - Ex: Google Drive, gmail, etc.

## Different Types of Scaling
- Vertical
    - you upgrade your current machine to a better spec

- Horizontal
    - you buy additional hardware for more power
