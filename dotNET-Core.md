## .NET Core v6

- .NET Runtime and ASP.NET Core Runtime in the SDK
- SDKs for Android, iOS, MacOS for developing native apps
- Something called .MAUI

## How it works

1. Write your source code
2. Compile it to CIL (Common Intermediate Language)
3. Framework stores compiled code in .dll file or .exe
4. The CLR (Common Language Runtime) converts CIL to executable machine code using Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler.

Takes advantage of controllers, services, and other middleware for abstraction purposes -- both security and organizational (separation of concerns, modularization).
